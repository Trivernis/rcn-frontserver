			The Raspberry pi Communication-Network is a network of Raspberry-Pi's.
			It's currently still in development. <br> The purpose of this server is to
			display the status of all raspberry-pi's in the network and the data
			of several sensors that are connected to these raspberry pi's. The data
			is stored in a database running on the main backend-server. The
			frontend-server is running either on a differend device or also on the
			backend-server-device. If this is the case, then the data is directly
			fetched from several json files instead of using webservices. The json-
			files are generated by a script running in the background that get's
			data from the database and stores it in these json-files every few
			seconds (depending on the type of data).
