        Welcome to the Raspberry Communication Network.

      <p class="justify">
        The Raspberry pi Communication-Network is a network of Raspberry-Pi's.
        It's currently still in development. <br> The purpose of this server is to
        display the status of all raspberry-pi's in the network and the data
        of several sensors that are connected to these raspberry pi's. The data
        is stored in a database running on the main backend-server. The
        frontend-server is running either on a differend device or also on the
        backend-server-device. If this is the case, then the data is directly
        fetched from several json files instead of using webservices. The json-
        files are generated by a script running in the background that get's
        data from the database and stores it in these json-files every few
        seconds (depending on the type of data).
